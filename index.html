    <div class="why">
    <h2>MY WHY</h2>
    <p>"...I really enjoy coming up with solutions to solve problems in my life and
       in society.I first came across programming while undertaking my undergrad
      course at the university.It was just one unit in my second year but I really
      fell in love with it.How I could easily solve simple problems through code.
      I decided that once I completed my degree I would explore my interest in
      this field. When the opportunity to join a coding class came up, I took it
      up and I am really enjoying the journey...."</p>
