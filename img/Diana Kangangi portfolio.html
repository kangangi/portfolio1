    <div class="why">
    <h2>MY WHY</h2>

    <p>I really enjoy coming up with solutions to solve problems in my life and
       in society.I first came across programming while undertaking my undergrad.
      It was one unit in my second year but I fell in love with it.
      I decided that once I completed my degree I would explore my interest in
      this field. When the opportunity to join a coding class came up, I took it
      up and I am really enjoying the journey</p>
    <p>I also acknowledge that there's a lot of suffering in the world be it through
    war, hunger, diseases, and poverty. I believe that if each of us took up the responsibility
    of improving ourselves and consequently bettering the world, the world would be a better
    place. This is my way of improving myself and making my contribution. </p>
